# Datastrike frontend

## 🚀 Project
This is the frontend part of Datastrike: an esport-oriented Overwatch tool. You can track, analyze, and scout data.

## 🧬 Features

### 📖 Tracking
Track your team's results with a nice and easy user interface. Add multiple maps from your scrim or official game and get some nice stats and charts about it.

### 📊 Analysis
Analyze your games with the generated log files from [ScrimTime](https://workshop.codes/DKEEH). All you have to do is import your log files, we handle the rest. 🫡\
Once imported, you'll get access to features such as timelines, and specific data by selecting stats/users and all the row data from the players.

### 🔎 Scouting
Our scouting functionality allows you to explore (thanks to [OverFast API](https://overfast-api.tekrop.fr/) by [@TeKroP](https://github.com/TeKrop)) data from Blizzard.\
For public profiles, you'll be able to retrieve general stats such as winrate, KDA, and detailed stats on each hero, role, etc.

### 📆 Multiple teams
We know it's common for someone to be part of multiple teams. Don't worry, our tool is 100% compatible with it, allowing you to switch very fast between your teams and showing you the data accordingly.
